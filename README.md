# AquaCalda.jl

[![Project Status: Pre-Alpha](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-pre--alpha-red.svg)](...)

**AquaCalda.jl** is a planned framework for high-performance, coupled Discrete Element Method (DEM) and heat transfer simulations, written in Julia.

## About The Project

The goal of this project is to create a modern, extensible, and user-friendly tool for researchers and students to model granular systems where thermal effects are important.

## Project Status: Pre-Alpha

This project is in the initial **6-month planning and architectural phase**.

There is currently **no stable or usable code**. The repository is being used to track initial development, design ideas, and establish the core structure. Please do not expect any functional components at this time.

## High-Level Goals

The initial development will focus on achieving the following core milestones:

*   A basic and validated DEM solver for spherical particles.
*   A simple heat transfer model for conduction between particles.
*   A clean, extensible, and well-documented public API.

## Contributing

While code contributions are not being sought at this very early stage, feel free to "watch" this repository to follow its progress. If you have ideas, suggestions, or want to discuss the project's direction, please open an issue!
